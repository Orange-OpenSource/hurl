/*
 * jsonpath specs
 * There is no proper specifications for jsonpath.
 * The defacto one is still https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
 * Hurl will try to follow this one as closely as possible
 *
 * There are a few edge cases for which several implementations differ
 * The online app https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/ might be used to test them
 * We describe below the behaviour that we expect in Hurl.
 *
 * Specify a field key in a subscript operator:  $['name']
 * The key must be enclosed within single quotes only.
 * The following expressions will not be valid: $["name"] and $[name]
 *
 * Accessing a key containing a single quote must be escape:  $['\'']
 * Key with unicode are supported: $['âœˆ']
 *
 * Any character within these quote won't have a specific meaning:
 * $['*'] selects the element with key '*'. It is different from $[*] which selects all elements
 * $['.'] selects the element with key '.'.
 *
 * The dot notation is usually more readable the the bracket notation
 * but it is more limited in terms of allowed characters
 * The following characters are allowed:
 *   alphanumeric
 *   _ (underscore)
 *
 * Filters can be applied to element of an array with the ?(@.key PREDICATE) notation.
 * The key can can specify one or more levels.
 * For example, `.price.US` specify field 'US' in an object for the field price.
 * The predicate if not present just checks the key existence.
