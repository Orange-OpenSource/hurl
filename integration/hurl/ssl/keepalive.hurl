# On reused connection, libcurl doesn't provide SSL certificate information, we can only get this from
# the first connection.
# Because of this, Hurl has to keep cache of certificate information by connection. This allows to make certificates
# asserts on reused connection even if libcurl doesn't provide these information.
# Note: this is only possible from curl 8.2.0
