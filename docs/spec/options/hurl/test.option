Activate test mode: with this, the HTTP response is not outputted anymore, progress is reported for each Hurl file tested, and a text summary is displayed when all files have been run.

In test mode, files are executed in parallel. To run test in a sequential way use `--job 1`.

See also [`--jobs`](#jobs).
