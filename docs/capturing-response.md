# Capturing Response

## Captures

Captures are optional values that are __extracted from the HTTP response__ and stored in a named variable.
These captures may be the response status code, part of or the entire the body, and response headers.

Captured variables can be accessed through a run session; each new value of a given variable overrides the last value.

Captures can be useful for using data from one request in another request, such as when working with [CSRF tokens].
Variables in a Hurl file can be created from captures or [injected into the session].

```hurl
# An example to show how to pass a CSRF token
# from one request to another:

# First GET request to get CSRF token value:
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
# Capture the CSRF token value from html body.
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath "normalize-space(//meta[@name='_csrf_token']/@content)"

# Do the login !
POST https://acmecorp.net/login?user=toto&password=1234
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
HTTP 302
```

Body responses can be encoded by server (see [`Content-Encoding` HTTP header]) but captures in Hurl files are not
affected by this content compression. All body captures (`body`, `bytes`, `sha256` etc...) work _after_ content decoding.

Finally, body text captures (`body`, `jsonpath`, `xpath` etc...) are also decoded to strings based on [`Content-Type` header]
so these queries can be captures as usual strings.


Structure of a capture:

<div class="schema-container schema-container u-font-size-2 u-font-size-3-sm">
 <div class="schema">
   <span class="schema-token schema-color-1">my_var<span class="schema-label">variable</span></span>
   <span> : </span>
   <span class="schema-token schema-color-2">xpath "string(//h1)"<span class="schema-label">query</span></span>
 </div>
</div>

A capture consists of a variable name, followed by `:` and a query. Captures
section starts with `[Captures]`.

### Query

Queries are used to extract data from an HTTP response.

A query can extract data from

- status line:
  - [`status`](#status-capture)
  - [`version`](#version-capture)
- headers:
  - [`header`](#header-capture)
  - [`cookie`](#cookie-capture)
- body:
  - [`body`](#body-capture)
  - [`bytes`](#bytes-capture)
  - [`rawBytes`](#raw-bytes-capture)
  - [`xpath`](#xpath-capture)
  - [`jsonpath`](#jsonpath-capture)
  - [`regex`](#regex-capture)
  - [`sha256`](#sha-256-capture)
  - [`md5`](#md5-capture)
- others:
  - [`url`](#url-capture)
  - [`redirects`](#redirects-capture)
  - [`ip`](#ip-address-capture)
  - [`variable`](#variable-capture)
  - [`duration`](#duration-capture)
  - [`certificate`](#ssl-certificate-capture)

Extracted data can then be further refined using [filters].

### Status capture

Capture the received HTTP response status code. Status capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`, and the
keyword `status`.

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_status: status
```

### Version capture

Capture the received HTTP version. Version capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`, and the
keyword `version`. The value captured is a string:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
http_version: version
```

### Header capture

Capture a header from the received HTTP response headers. Header capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`,
then the keyword `header` and a header name.

```hurl
POST https://example.org/login
[Form]
user: toto
password: 12345678
HTTP 302
[Captures]
next_url: header "Location"
```

### Cookie capture

Capture a [`Set-Cookie`] header from the received HTTP response headers. Cookie
capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`, then the keyword `cookie`
and a cookie name.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/cookies/set
HTTP 200
[Captures]
session-id: cookie "LSID"
```

Cookie attributes value can also be captured by using the following format:
`<cookie-name>[cookie-attribute]`. The following attributes are supported:
`Value`, `Expires`, `Max-Age`, `Domain`, `Path`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite`.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/cookies/set
HTTP 200
[Captures]
value1: cookie "LSID"
value2: cookie "LSID[Value]"     # Equivalent to the previous capture
expires: cookie "LSID[Expires]"
max-age: cookie "LSID[Max-Age]"
domain: cookie "LSID[Domain]"
path: cookie "LSID[Path]"
secure: cookie "LSID[Secure]"
http-only: cookie "LSID[HttpOnly]"
same-site: cookie "LSID[SameSite]"
```

### Body capture

Capture the entire body (decoded as text) from the received HTTP response. The encoding used to decode the body 
is based on the `charset` value in the `Content-Type` header response.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_body: body
```

If the `Content-Type` doesn't include any encoding hint, a [`decode` filter] can be used to explicitly decode the body response
bytes.

```hurl
# Our HTML response is encoded using GB 2312.
# But, the 'Content-Type' HTTP response header doesn't precise any charset,
# so we decode explicitly the bytes.
GET https://example.org/cn
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_body: bytes decode "gb2312"
```

`body` capture works _after_ content encoding decompression (so the captured value is not affected by `Content-Encoding` response header).

### Bytes capture

Capture the entire body (as a raw bytestream) from the received HTTP response

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.bin
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_data: bytes
```

Like `body` capture, `bytes` capture works _after_ content encoding decompression (so the captured value is not
affected by `Content-Encoding` response header).

### Raw bytes capture

Capture the entire body (as a raw bytestream) from the received HTTP response

```hurl
GET https://example.org
Content-Encoding: gzip
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_data: rawBytes
```

Unlike all other captures, the `rawBytes` capture works _before_ content encoding decompression.
This is the only way to capture a body which would otherwise be automatically decoded.

### XPath capture

Capture a [XPath] query from the received HTTP body decoded as a string.
Currently, only XPath 1.0 expression can be used.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
# Capture the identifier from the dom node <div id="pet0">5646eaf23</div
HTTP 200
[Captures]
pet-id: xpath "normalize-space(//div[@id='pet0'])"

# Open the captured page.
GET https://example.org/home/pets/{{pet-id}}
HTTP 200
```

XPath captures are not limited to node values (like string, or boolean); any
valid XPath can be captured and asserted with variable asserts.

```hurl
# Test that the XML endpoint return 200 pets
GET https://example.org/api/pets
HTTP 200
[Captures]
pets: xpath "//pets"
[Asserts]
variable "pets" count == 200
```

XPath expression can also be evaluated against part of the body with a [`xpath` filter]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home_cn
HTTP 200
[Captures]
pet-id: bytes decode "gb2312" xpath "normalize-space(//div[@id='pet0'])"
```

### JSONPath capture

Capture a [JSONPath] query from the received HTTP body.

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/contact
[Form]
token: {{token}}
email: toto@rookie.net
HTTP 200
[Captures]
contact-id: jsonpath "$['id']"
```

> Explain that the value selected by the JSONPath is coerced to a string when only one node is selected.

As with [XPath captures], JSONPath captures can be anything from string, number, to object and collections.
For instance, if we have a JSON endpoint that returns the following JSON:

```
{
  "a_null": null,
  "an_object": {
    "id": "123"
  },
  "a_list": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "an_integer": 1,
  "a float": 1.1,
  "a_bool": true,
  "a_string": "hello"
}
```

We can capture the following paths:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/captures-json
HTTP 200
[Captures]
an_object:  jsonpath "$['an_object']"
a_list:     jsonpath "$['a_list']"
a_null:     jsonpath "$['a_null']"
an_integer: jsonpath "$['an_integer']"
a_float:    jsonpath "$['a_float']"
a_bool:     jsonpath "$['a_bool']"
a_string:   jsonpath "$['a_string']"
all:        jsonpath "$"
```

### Regex capture

Capture a regex pattern from the HTTP received body, decoded as text.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/helloworld
HTTP 200
[Captures]
id_a: regex "id_a:([0-9]+)"
id_b: regex "id_b:(\\d+)"   # pattern using double quote 
id_c: regex /id_c:(\d+)/    # pattern using forward slash
name: regex "Hello ([a-zA-Z]+)"
```

The regex pattern must have at least one capture group, otherwise the
capture will fail. When the pattern is a double-quoted string, metacharacters beginning with a backslash in the pattern
(like `\d`, `\s`) must be escaped; literal pattern enclosed by `/` can also be used to avoid metacharacters escaping.

The regex syntax is documented at <https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>. For instance, one can use [flags](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#grouping-and-flags)
to enable case-insensitive match:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/hello
HTTP 200
[Captures]
word: regex /(?i)hello (\w+)!/
```

### SHA-256 capture

Capture the [SHA-256] hash of the response body.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_hash: sha256
```

Like `body` assert, `sha256` capture works _after_ content encoding decompression (so the captured value is not
affected by `Content-Encoding` response header).

### MD5 capture

Capture the [MD5] hash of the response body.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Captures]
my_hash: md5
```

Like `sha256` asserts, `md5` assert works _after_ content encoding decompression (so the predicates values are not
affected by `Content-Encoding` response header)

### URL capture

Capture the last fetched URL. This is most meaningful if you have told Hurl to follow redirection (see [`[Options]` section][options] or
[`--location` option]). URL capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`, and the keyword `url`.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/redirecting
[Options]
location: true
HTTP 200
[Captures]
landing_url: url
```

### Redirects capture

Capture each step of redirection. This is most meaningful if you have told Hurl to follow redirection (see [`[Options]`section][options] or
[`--location` option]). Redirects capture consists of a variable name, followed by a `:`, and the keyword `redirects`.
Redirects query returns a collection so each step of the redirection can be capture.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/redirecting/1
[Options]
location: true
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
redirects count == 3
[Captures]
step1: redirects nth 0 location
step2: redirects nth 1 location
step3: redirects nth 2 location
```

### IP address capture

Capture the IP address of the last connection. The value of the `ip` query is a string.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/hello
HTTP 200
[Captures]
server_ip: ip
```

### Variable capture

Capture the value of a variable into another.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/helloworld
HTTP 200
[Captures]
in: body
name: variable "in"
```

### Duration capture

Capture the response time of the request in ms.

```hurl
GET https://example.org/helloworld
HTTP 200
[Captures]
duration_in_ms: duration
```

### SSL certificate capture

Capture the SSL certificate properties. Certificate capture consists of the keyword `certificate`, followed by the certificate attribute value.

The following attributes are supported: `Subject`, `Issuer`, `Start-Date`, `Expire-Date` and `Serial-Number`.

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
cert_subject: certificate "Subject"
cert_issuer: certificate "Issuer"
cert_expire_date: certificate "Expire-Date"
cert_serial_number: certificate "Serial-Number"
```

## Redacting Secrets

When capturing data, you may need to hide captured values from logs and report. To do this, captures can use secrets
which are redacted from logs and reports, using [`--secret` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --secret pass=sesame-ouvre-toi file.hurl
```

If the secret value to be redacted is dynamic, or not known before execution, a capture can become a secret using `redact`
at the end of the query's capture:

```hurl
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
[Captures]
pass: header "token" redact
```
